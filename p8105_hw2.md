importing and cleaning dataset

  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(

merging snp and pols_month

``` r
pols_snp_merge = left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
```

merging unemployment into our merged dataset

``` r
fivethirtyeight_merge = full_join(pols_snp_merge, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"), copy = TRUE)
```

**description** The pols_month data set contains 822 observations of 9
variables regarding number republican or democratic national politicians
associated with the month & year. The snp data set contains 787
observations of 3 variables relating to the closing value of the S&P
stock index associated month & year. The unemployment data set contains
816 observations of 3 variables pertaining to the percentage of
unemployment associated with the month & year. When merging all three
data sets together, it creates a data set that contains 828 observations
of 11 variables, with information pertaining to unemployment percentage
and S&P stock index closing value, and whether the president during the
associated month & date was republican or democrat. The relevant years
with no missing information is from Jan 1950 - Jun 2015. The key
variables to look at would be the year, `president`, `close`, and
`value`.

## problem 2

importing and cleaning data, making sure that all variable names are
labeled the same for easy merge

``` r
trash =  
  readxl::read_excel("./TrashWheelCollectionData.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A3:N586", col_names = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons", "volume (cubic yards)", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts", "glass_bottles", "plastic_bags", "wrappers", "sports", "homes_powered")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (
    (weight_tons*500)/1000), 
    trash_var = "mr.trash_wheel", 
    year = as.integer(year)) 

trash_wheel =
  readxl::read_excel("./TrashWheelCollectionData.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A3:M108", col_names = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons", "volume (cubic yards)", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts", "glass_bottles", "plastic_bags", "wrappers", "homes_powered")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (
    (weight_tons*500)/1000), 
    year = as.integer(year), 
    trash_var = "prof_trash_wheel") 

gwynnda =
  readxl::read_excel("./TrashWheelCollectionData.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A3:L157", col_names = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons", "volume (cubic yards)", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts",  "plastic_bags", "wrappers", "homes_powered")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(homes_powered = (
    (weight_tons*500)/1000), 
    year = as.integer(year), 
    trash_var = "gwynnda")
```

merging all data set:

``` r
trash_tidy = 
  bind_rows(trash, trash_wheel, gwynnda) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  relocate(trash_var)
```

cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July 2021

``` r
gwynnda_july <- subset(gwynnda, month == "July" & year == "2021")
```

**description:** This data set contains estimated trash gathered from a
water-wheel vessel that removes trash from the Inner Harbor in
Baltimore, Maryland. It contains 845 observations and 15 variables. Some
key variables in this data set includes `weight_tons`,
`volumne_cubic_yards`, and `homes_powered`. The total weight of trash
collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 216.26 tons. The total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July 2021 was 1.63^{4}

## problem 3

importing baseline data

``` r
baseline = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1)%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `0` = "female"),
    apoe4 = recode(apoe4, `1` = "carrier", `0` = "non-carrier")) %>% 
    filter(age_at_onset > current_age | age_at_onset == ".")
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
developed_mci =
  baseline |> 
  filter(age_at_onset != ".")
```

**description:** Because the first row in the data set was not the
variables, but was information of what the numeric values indicate, I
had to specify to R to skip the first row and read the second row as the
variable column. Additionally, I re-coded sex so that the output would
either be female or male and apoe4 as carrier or non-carrier since they
were numeric values in the raw dataset. I then excluded those who’s
`age_at_onset` predates `current_age` as they did not meet the inclusion
criteria. 479 participants were recruited and of these participants, 93
developed MCI. The average baseline age in this study was 65.0286013
years old. The proportion of women in the study who are APOE4 carriers
is 30%.

importing longitudinally observed biomarker values:

``` r
amyloid = 
  read_csv("./data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "time",
    names_prefix = "time_"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = study_id, 
    time = recode(time, "baseline" = "0"),
    id = as.integer(id)) %>% 
  select (id, everything(), -study_id)
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

**description:** Similar to the baseline data set, the amyloid data
set’s first row gave information of the units, thus I had to specify to
R to skip the first row and read the second row as the variable. I then
created a new variable `time` and moved the columns into that variable
through using the pivot_longer function so that I will be able to merge
the dataset. I also had to change the variable `study_id` to `id` so
that it would match the baseline data variables. There are 487
participants in this data set with 3 variables.

checking to see if some participants only appear in baseline or amyloid
data set

``` r
mci_2 <- anti_join(baseline, amyloid, by = "id" )
```

There are 8 participants that only appear in only the baseline or
amyloid dataset.

merging data set together:

``` r
mci_merge = inner_join(baseline, amyloid, by = "id")
```

**description:** In the mci_merge data set, I did an inner_join of the
baseline and amyloid data set by variable `id` to ensure that only that
appear in both datasets are retained. After merging, there are 471
participants with `n rcol(mci_merge)` varibles left in the study.

exporting results as csv onto desktop

``` r

write.csv(mci_merge, file = p8105_hw2_nn2477, row.names = FALSE)
